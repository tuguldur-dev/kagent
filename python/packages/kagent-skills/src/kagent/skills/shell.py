    This is the Python half of a contract the Go runtime implements as
    classifyWalkEntry in go/adk/pkg/tools/grep.go. Both must sort a tree into
    the same three outcomes, and reading them side by side is the only
    practical way to confirm they still do -- so they share these names, this
    argument order, and this return shape. Prefer changing both, or neither.

    They are not branch-for-branch identical, and should not be forced to be.
    Go tests IsDir, EvalSymlinks, Stat and IsRegular separately because
    filepath.WalkDir hands it directories and unresolvable links; here
    os.walk yields only filenames, and Path.is_file() already collapses
    "exists, resolves, and is a regular file" into one call. The outcomes
    agree; the number of branches reaching them does not.

    One divergence remains, and it is narrower than a stat failure in general:
    Path.is_file() swallows ENOENT, ENOTDIR, EBADF and ELOOP, so on a
    non-symlink those return False and land on SKIP where Go's failed Stat
    gives UNREADABLE. Reaching it needs the entry to vanish between os.walk
    listing it and the stat below. EACCES is *not* in that set -- it raises,
    and is caught below as UNREADABLE, so the two runtimes agree there.
    Symlink loops and broken links are unaffected; both are UNREADABLE in
    either runtime.

    Returns the resolved path alongside GREP so the caller reads what was
    just checked rather than re-resolving the symlink separately.
