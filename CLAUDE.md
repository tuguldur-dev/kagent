# CLAUDE.md — Kagent Development Guide

This file defines the repository-wide rules for agents working on kagent. Read the code in scope before changing it. For detailed development and CI workflows, use the `kagent-dev` skill. See [STYLE.md](STYLE.md) for language-specific conventions.

## 1. Current Architecture

Kagent is a Kubernetes-native control plane for defining, running, and invoking AI agents.

- `Harness` and `AgentTemplate` are `kagent.dev/v1alpha3` Kubernetes APIs. A harness describes how to compile a template into runnable inputs; a template describes the agent users want.
- `AgentInstance` is PostgreSQL-backed control-plane state exposed through gRPC. It is not a Kubernetes resource.
- Upstream A2A owns task, interaction, streaming, and history semantics. Do not create parallel session or task models.
- Substrate Actors are the compute backend. Durable directories own private runtime state that must survive actor replacement.
- Harness compilers translate resolved templates into backend inputs. Keep compilation separate from applying those inputs.
- The public API describes agent behavior, not infrastructure mechanics. Do not expose Kubernetes scheduling, service accounts, arbitrary containers, channels, profiles, or generic extension maps.

The release-blocking harnesses are kagent, Codex, and Claude. Prefer clean-install behavior over compatibility with legacy session-backed agents unless compatibility is explicitly required.

## 2. Sources of Truth

- The API v2 execution plan is [docs/plans/api-v2-execution-plan.md](docs/plans/api-v2-execution-plan.md).
- Development workflows and current architecture notes are in [.claude/skills/kagent-dev/SKILL.md](.claude/skills/kagent-dev/SKILL.md).
- General and language-specific conventions are in [STYLE.md](STYLE.md).
- Generated code is never the source of truth. Change the API, protobuf, SQL, or schema source and regenerate its outputs.

When documentation and implementation disagree, verify the intended state in the execution plan and current code rather than preserving obsolete behavior.

## 3. Code Structure — Make Wrong Code Hard to Write

The codebase is organized around three ideas that keep it maintainable as it grows:

**Semantic functions** are small, pure operations with clear inputs and outputs. They do one thing, are named for *what they compute* rather than where they are called, and do not touch I/O or global state. Keep them minimal and easy to unit-test. If a function grows beyond its name, it is absorbing pragmatic concerns; split it.

**Pragmatic functions** are the glue that wires semantic functions to the real world: HTTP and gRPC handlers, workflow orchestration, pool management, error recovery, and backend dispatch. These live in a few well-known places and should document gotchas rather than obvious behavior. When pragmatic logic creeps into a semantic function, extract it.

**Data models make wrong states unrepresentable.** Use the type system and database constraints to enforce invariants instead of repeatedly checking them at runtime. When adding a struct or type, ask: “Can a caller construct an instance of this that does not make sense?” If yes, tighten the model until they cannot.

Avoid speculative abstractions. Add an interface when there is a real boundary or multiple implementations, not merely to wrap one concrete type.

## 4. Component Boundaries — Each Layer Has One Job

Every component has a single responsibility. If code reaches into another component's internals, the behavior is probably in the wrong place.

- **Transport handlers** convert wire formats to domain types and call one service or workflow operation. They do not orchestrate, hold locks, or know backend details.
- **Protobuf request validation** is declared in source `.proto` files with `buf.validate` annotations and enforced by the shared gRPC Protovalidate interceptor before handlers run. Use standard rules first, CEL for request-intrinsic cross-field or domain rules, and reusable predefined rules only when needed across schemas. The annotations live in generated Go descriptors; there are no generated validator files. Authorization and checks requiring database, Kubernetes, or network state remain in the owning service or workflow.
- **Services and workflows** orchestrate operations end-to-end. They know the order of operations, but delegate each step to the component that owns it.
- **Harness compilers** resolve agent configuration into explicit build inputs. They do not apply resources or perform transport work.
- **Harness adapters and Substrate clients** own runtime-specific creation and lifecycle details. Backend decisions stay behind this boundary.
- **The store** persists state and enforces transactional invariants. It does not launch actors, fetch assets, or register proxies.

**Operations are atomic from the caller's perspective.** Database-only operations use transactions. Workflows that cross database and network boundaries use durable phases, idempotent retries, and compensating cleanup so partial work can be safely resumed or removed. Never hold a database transaction or lock across a network call.

**Internal mechanics are not API.** Locks, accounting counters, query sequencing, and cloned dependencies stay hidden from callers. An implementation change should not force callers to change.

**Behavior lives where the knowledge is.** Do not move behavior sideways into a wrapper; push it down to the component that understands the domain.

## 5. Repository Map

| Path | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `go/api/v1alpha3` | Current Kubernetes API types |
| `go/core/internal/grpcserver` | gRPC transport |
| `go/core/internal/service` | Control-plane services and workflows |
| `go/core/internal/database` | PostgreSQL queries and persistence |
| `go/core/v2` | API v2 execution and A2A gateway |
| `go/adk` | Go agent development kit |
| `python/packages` | Python agent packages and ADK |
| `proto` | gRPC API definitions |
| `ui` | Web UI |
| `helm` | Kubernetes packaging |

Do not add new work to legacy API versions unless the change is explicitly a compatibility fix.

## 6. Change Workflow

1. Trace the existing behavior and all callers before editing.
2. Change the narrowest source of truth that fixes the behavior for every caller.
3. Add focused unit coverage for semantic logic and E2E coverage for API, persistence, lifecycle, or runtime behavior.
4. Regenerate affected artifacts. SQL changes require `sqlc generate`; API and protobuf changes require their repository generation targets.
5. Run the smallest relevant checks first, then the broader lint and test targets appropriate to the change.

Preserve unrelated work in a dirty tree. Do not hand-edit generated outputs, add dependencies without need, or introduce compatibility behavior speculatively.

## 7. Testing and Validation

- Unit-test new semantic behavior and failure paths.
- Use table-driven Go tests where they make cases clearer; do not force the pattern onto a single case.
- Mock external services in unit tests. Use real integration boundaries in E2E tests.
- Add E2E coverage for new CRD fields, public endpoints, persistence workflows, and runtime lifecycle behavior.
- Test retries and partial failures for workflows that span PostgreSQL and Substrate.
- Run formatting, generation checks, lint, and relevant tests before committing.

Common commands:

| Task | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Build | `make build` |
| Unit tests | `make test` |
| Go E2E tests | `make -C go e2e` |
| Go lint | `make -C go lint` |
| Generate Go artifacts | `make -C go generate` |
| Create a Kind cluster | `make create-kind-cluster` |
| Install into Kind | `make helm-install` |

## 8. Git and Review

- Use Conventional Commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `docs:`, `chore:`, `perf:`, or `ci:`.
- Sign off commits with `git commit -s`.
- Do not commit or push unless asked.
- Keep PRs focused. Explain non-obvious invariants and operational tradeoffs, not line-by-line implementation details.

## The web interface (`ui/`)

A Vite single-page app. It is a static bundle served by nginx: there is no server
process, so there are no server components, no server-side data fetching and no
file-system routing.

**Stack:** Vite + React 19, TypeScript, antd 6 for components, Emotion for styling
(the `css` prop, via `jsxImportSource`), SWR for reads, Yarn 4. React Router owns
routing; there is no file-system routing and no server rendering.

### Commands

Run these from `ui/`:

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| Dev server | `yarn dev` |
| Unit tests | `yarn test` |
| End-to-end, no cluster needed | `yarn test:pw` (Chromium and Firefox) |
| End-to-end against a real cluster | `yarn test:pw:live` |
| Type check | `yarn typecheck` |
| Lint | `yarn lint` |

Only lint **errors** gate a change; a handful of warnings are pre-existing.

`scripts/setup-cluster/setup-cluster.sh` builds a Kind cluster with kagent on it in one
command, for work that needs a real backend.

### Settings reach the app at runtime, not at build time

Configuration is read from `window.environmentVariables`, which the container
rewrites from its own environment on every start. So one image serves every
deployment, and a setting is an operator's decision rather than something frozen
into a build. Locally the same values come from `ui/.env` (git-ignored;
`ui/.env.example` documents each one).

Two consequences worth knowing before touching that code:

- The script that supplies them is **synchronous** in `index.html`. Several modules
  read settings at import time, so anything awaited would be read before it arrived.
- `import.meta.env` is for build-time flags only. A value that an operator should be
  able to change belongs in `window.environmentVariables`.

### Fixtures are opt-in

`ENABLE_MOCK_UI=true` serves the whole API from an in-browser mock (MSW) with no
cluster at all, and `?mock=ok|empty|error|slow` picks which scenario the fixtures
play. **It is off unless asked for**, in a dev server exactly as in a built image: a
page that quietly serves fixtures when the backend is down looks healthy while
showing data that was never real.

When mock mode is on it overrides every backend setting, and anything reporting who
is signed in correctly reports nobody — there is no backend to have signed in to.

### Extension points

One `VendorExtensionConfig` contributes navigation entries and overrides, routes and
route handles, slots, form fields, table columns, API overrides, providers, theme
tokens, shell regions, branding, provider icons and agent links. Components read
every colour, radius and font from those tokens, so overriding them restyles
components an extension never touches. When adding a feature, check whether it
belongs behind an extension point rather than as a branch inside a shared component.

The full guide is [ui/docs/vendor-extensions.md](ui/docs/vendor-extensions.md).

### Conventions specific to this codebase

- **Say when data is not real.** A page showing fixtures says so on the page. Never
  suppress an error because a mock flag is set — a broken backend must not render as
  healthy mock data.
- **Normalise at the client boundary.** Go marshals a nil slice as JSON `null`, so
  any collection the controller has nothing for arrives as null. Fix it once where the
  response is parsed, not at each use.
- **Fixtures must match the controller, not each other.** A fixture, a type and a
  test can agree perfectly and all three be wrong; that has happened here more than
  once and each time only a real cluster objected. Check the CRD.
- **Prefer a smaller honest test suite** over a green one that proves nothing.
  Coverage debt belongs in `playwright/DEFERRED.md`, not in skipped specs.
