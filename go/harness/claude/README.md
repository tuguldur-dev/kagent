# Claude Harness

The Claude Harness runs Claude Code as a native Kagent runtime. It compiles an
`AgentTemplate` into Claude Code configuration, runs each turn in a Substrate
Actor, and exposes the result through Kagent's A2A API.

## Code structure

The controller and Actor share only the versioned config contract. Kubernetes
resolution stays in the controller; native process behavior stays in this
harness.

| Path | Look here for |
| --- | --- |
| [`../../core/internal/translator/claude`](../../core/internal/translator/claude) | Translating `Harness`, `AgentTemplate`, model, MCP, plugin, and Secret inputs into a runtime revision and warnings |
| [`config/config.go`](config/config.go) | The versioned JSON contract shared by the compiler and runtime, including defaults and reserved environment variables |
| [`cmd/main.go`](cmd/main.go) | Actor startup, environment inputs, Claude version validation, continuation-store wiring, and private A2A startup |
| [`internal/adapter/adapter.go`](internal/adapter/adapter.go) | Materializing Claude home, skills, MCP config, and ephemeral provider credentials |
| [`internal/driver`](internal/driver) | Claude CLI arguments, stream-JSON parsing, runtime-event translation, cancellation, and process supervision |

## Working

- [x] Anthropic, Amazon Bedrock, and Vertex AI model providers
- [x] Streaming text, tool calls, and tool results over A2A
- [x] Task cancellation
- [x] Durable Claude session resume between turns
- [x] Claude Code built-in tools
- [x] Shared local subagents
- [x] Standalone skills and plugin-provided skills
- [x] Direct HTTP and SSE MCP servers with whole-server tool access

## Planned / not yet supported

- [ ] Human-in-the-loop tool approval with deferred tool calls and session resume
- [ ] Checkpoint and fork continuity for Claude sessions
- [ ] Enforced selection of individual tools from an MCP server
- [ ] Dedicated subagents running in separate AgentInstances
- [ ] Skills, MCP tools, and nested subagents on local subagents
- [ ] Configuring Claude Code permission mode and trust boundary in Harness CRD
