# API v2 execution plan

## Summary

Land API v2 through four milestones:

1. Merge #2362 and freeze final CRD/gRPC contracts.
2. Deliver a usable single-agent vertical slice with the existing kagent runtime.
3. Add composition, Codex, Claude, UI/CLI/MCP cutover, and remove legacy APIs.
4. Add single-member checkpoint/fork using released Substrate snapshot support.

API v2 is not complete until checkpoint/fork and their Substrate dependencies pass E2E coverage.

Public invariants:

- `Harness` and `AgentTemplate` are `kagent.dev/v1alpha3` CRDs.
- `AgentInstance` is a PostgreSQL-backed gRPC resource.
- One AgentInstance owns one rooted template tree and one A2A context.
- `A2A context_id == AgentInstance.id`.
- A2A owns interaction and history; AgentInstanceService owns catalog, lifecycle, metadata, and sharing.
- Every quiescent A2A turn is durably suspended to an exact snapshot before its
  final state is published; physical Actor suspension does not change a ready
  AgentInstance's logical state.
- Substrate is the only compute backend.
- No public scheduling, service-account, Deployment, channel, profile, or BYO fields.
- V1 release-blocking adapters are kagent, Codex, and Claude.

K7 and K8 can run in parallel after K3. The external Substrate track can run alongside all kagent work. K3 and K5 initially use Substrate's Kubernetes `ActorTemplate` API; K5A replaces that temporary bridge with Substrate's database-backed ate-api `ActorTemplate` resource.

## PRs

### K0 — Merge #2362: controller REST-to-gRPC transport ✅

Scope:

- Merge #2362 without AgentInstance or SessionService cleanup.
- Keep private `TaskStoreService` wrapping upstream A2A `Task`.
- Preserve existing user-facing A2A and session/task behavior.
- Pin generation inputs and ensure committed output is reproducible.

Gate:

- Go, Python, UI, Buf, Helm, and generated-output checks pass.
- This becomes the base for every subsequent PR.

### K1 — Add final v1alpha3 configuration CRDs ✅

Add `Harness` and `AgentTemplate`; do not mutate old CRDs into the new meanings.

`Harness`:

- Initially supports typed `kagent`, `codex`, and `claude` variants.
- Owns digest-pinned runtime image, environment/credential references, WorkerPool reference, snapshot policy, admission selector, capabilities, and health conditions.
- Creates no Actor merely by existing.
- Has no service account, Kubernetes scheduling, Deployment, channel, native-profile, or generic extension fields.

`AgentTemplate`:

- Owns model, prompt, prompt-template sources, MCP tools, standalone skills, plugin selections, and AgentTemplate-backed tools.
- Agent bindings have `name`, required routing `description`, same-namespace `templateRef`, and `Shared`/`Dedicated` isolation.
- Explicitly lists acceptable Harnesses.

Status:

- Harness status publishes one controller-derived capability record.
- AgentTemplate status has one bounded preparation entry per explicitly requested Harness: desired revision, latest successful revision, and `Accepted`, `ResolvedRefs`, `Compatible`, and `Prepared` conditions.

Also regenerate deepcopy code, CRDs, Helm CRDs, RBAC, and validation tests.

### K2 — Freeze lifecycle and checkpoint protobuf contracts

Add generated contracts but register services only as their implementations land.

Services:

- `AgentInstanceService`: create, get, list, suspend, resume, delete.
- Share RPCs: create, list, and revoke AgentInstance shares.
- `CheckpointService`: create/get/list/delete checkpoint and fork.
- Standard `google.longrunning.Operations` contract for checkpoint and fork.

Semantics:

- IDs are opaque and server-generated.
- Creation requires namespace, Harness, AgentTemplate, and caller-scoped `request_id`.
- Listing defaults to creator ownership; audited operators may request all creators.
- Labels are copied immutably from the root AgentTemplate.
- Share creation returns the secret token once; listing returns share IDs and metadata; revocation uses share ID.
- Read-only shares allow A2A get/list/subscribe; read-write shares additionally allow send/cancel.

Use a pinned upstream A2A v1 protobuf dependency. Do not maintain an editable kagent fork of upstream A2A definitions.

### K3 — Preparation and immutable revision storage

Implement the single-boundary compiler using existing SandboxAgent compilation code:

- Resolve bilateral Harness/AgentTemplate attachment.
- Render prompts and ConfigMap `include` sources.
- Extract reusable prompt, model, and MCP helpers instead of synthesizing a SandboxAgent or duplicating its compiler.
- Resolve Harness, ModelConfig, and MCP credential references for validation and hashing. Preserve Kubernetes credentials as `SecretKeyRef` entries in the generated workload; never persist or report their values.
- Initially reject standalone skills, plugin bundles, and AgentTemplate-backed tools with precise unsupported-field conditions.
- Create one immutable `ate.dev/v1alpha1` Kubernetes ActorTemplate per prepared revision, using a deterministic revision-hashed name. Do not emulate the future stable ActorTemplate/ActorTemplateVersion split.
- Build the Kubernetes ActorTemplate directly: pinned Harness image, environment/config values and `SecretKeyRef`s, worker-pool selector, `/data` DurableDir, snapshot policy, gRPC port 80, and HTTP readiness on `/readyz:8081`. Do not create a PodTemplate or Kubernetes config Secret.
- Use the fixed `gvisor` sandbox class supported by the Kubernetes API. Do not add a Harness field or controller flag; `gvisor-default` SandboxConfig selection starts with the later ate-api cutover.
- Watch Kubernetes ActorTemplate status for readiness and golden-snapshot completion.
- Record sanitized prepared revisions in PostgreSQL, including source identities and hashes, resolved egress destinations, Kubernetes ActorTemplate namespace/name/UID, phase, and golden-snapshot identity.
- Keep the last successful revision usable while a newer revision prepares.
- Retain revisions through direct database foreign keys from attachments and, later, instances and checkpoints. Do not add generic artifacts or reference counters.
- Retire attachments without blocking Harness or AgentTemplate deletion; delete unreferenced versions immediately and let the last instance/checkpoint release trigger deferred cleanup.

Compile resolved model and MCP destinations into the revision for K5 to materialize as actor-scoped egress policy. K3 does not create EgressPolicy or Credential resources.

No Actor is created in this PR.

### K4 — Add upstream A2A gRPC to the kagent runtime

Add the pinned upstream A2A v1 gRPC server to Go and Python kagent runtimes:

- Support send, streaming send, get/list/cancel/subscribe, and gRPC health.
- Continue using kagent's existing session and TaskStore services until the public gateway owns persistence; mount the K3 DurableDir without switching these stores to SQLite.
- Serve the private runtime contract on upstream A2A gRPC port 80; legacy HTTP/JSON-RPC compatibility is not required.
- Serve a health-only HTTP `/readyz` endpoint on fixed port 8081 for Substrate readiness. It is not an A2A or legacy compatibility endpoint.
- Keep #2362’s TaskStore integration for legacy SandboxAgents until K19.
- Do not change public controller routes yet.

This establishes the final gateway-to-runtime contract independently of AgentInstance.

### K5 — AgentInstance create/get/list/delete

Add PostgreSQL tables and the registered service implementation:

- `agent_instance`
- `agent_instance_member`
- creation idempotency records
- AgentInstance shares
- prepared-revision references and tombstones

Creation:

- Select the latest successful prepared revision.
- Reserve caller/namespace/request ID transactionally.
- Execute AgentInstance create and delete synchronously within their RPCs.
- Create the deterministic Substrate Actor in its initial suspended state; Substrate establishes runtime readiness while preparing the ActorTemplate.
- Publish the logical A2A authority and transition to `READY`.
- Retrying a canceled create with the same request ID re-enters the same deterministic workflow.
- Never duplicate a member while creation outcome is unknown.

Deletion fences interaction, deletes owned Actors, releases its prepared-revision foreign key, triggers cleanup when that was the final reference, and leaves an indefinitely retained V1 tombstone. No retention configuration is added until scale requires one.

Start with single-member prepared revisions; K9 extends the same state machine to multiple members without changing the public API.

### K5A — Adopt ate-api ActorTemplate resources 🚧

Substrate models each immutable prepared runtime as one uniquely named, Atespace-owned `ActorTemplate`; there is no separate `ActorTemplateVersion` resource. The template's metadata version is an optimistic-concurrency version that advances as Substrate records golden-snapshot status, not a selectable runtime version.

- Preserve the compiler, prepared-revision digest and deterministic template name. Translate each revision directly into one ate-api `ActorTemplate`.
- Use the Kubernetes namespace as the Atespace, ensure that Atespace exists before template creation, and select the fixed `gvisor-default` SandboxConfig.
- Resolve credentials before this boundary and send literal environment values. Do not grant ate-api access to kagent Secret or ConfigMap sources.
- Replace the Kubernetes ActorTemplate informer and write client with ate-api create/get/delete calls. Since ate-api has no template watch, poll only non-terminal templates until `golden_snapshot` is present or `error_message` reports failure.
- Store the stable template Atespace, name, and server-assigned UID on the prepared revision. Do not persist Substrate's mutable resource version or duplicate golden-snapshot status.
- Create Actors with `Actor.actor_template` set to the exact prepared template `ObjectRef`; stop populating the legacy Kubernetes template namespace/name fields.
- Keep prepared-revision retention, latest-successful selection, AgentInstance/checkpoint/fork behavior, and public APIs unchanged.
- Require existing AgentInstances to be recreated. Do not add dual-write, backfill, or a legacy compatibility path.
- Delete the Kubernetes ActorTemplate construction, collection, reconciliation, diagnostics, and RBAC bridge in the same cutover. WorkerPool remains a Kubernetes resource.
- Delete each unreferenced template and its golden Actor. Until Substrate implements that documented behavior, the kagent adapter deletes `ate-golden/<template UID>` explicitly; snapshot reclamation remains Substrate GC's responsibility.

Completion requires clean-install preparation, lifecycle, checkpoint, fork, conflict, failed-golden, and unreferenced-revision cleanup coverage against ate-api resources.

### K6 — Suspend, resume, and failure reconciliation

Implement lifecycle for the root runtime:

- Explicit suspend rejects active work, fences ingress, ensures the Actor is
  suspended, and changes the AgentInstance's logical state to `SUSPENDED`.
- Resume restores the Actor and health before returning logical `READY`.
- Conflicting lifecycle operations return `ABORTED`.
- Missing or mismatched Actors transition the instance to `FAILED`; reconciliation never silently replaces them.
- Public history remains readable while suspended or failed.
- Emit lifecycle audit records, traces, and member-level failure details without exposing Actor IDs through ordinary APIs.

### K7 — Agent Plugins ingestion

Implement the selected Agent Plugins 1.0.0 subset:

- Immutable OCI digest, full Git commit, and versioned S3-compatible ZIP sources.
- Validate the canonical root `plugin.json`.
- Materialize only explicitly selected Agent Skills and supporting files.
- Use Go ADK's native `skilltoolset` for skill discovery, validation,
  instruction loading, and resource loading. Keep only kagent's execution
  tools (`read_file`, `write_file`, `edit_file`, and `bash`) rather than
  maintaining duplicate skill-loading code.
- Load standard `mcp.json` entries for stdio, Streamable HTTP, and legacy SSE
  transports into the runtime configuration.
- Reject path traversal, escaping symlinks, duplicate skill names, mutable references, and oversized packages.
- Ignore client extensions and content outside the Agent Plugins 1.0.0 skills
  and MCP component types.
- Pin immutable source identities in the prepared revision. Fetch and validate
  package contents only in the runtime; destinations discovered in `mcp.json`
  remain blocked unless explicitly allowed by a future API.

Reuse existing artifact and skill materialization code where possible.

### K8 — Shared AgentTemplate tools

Extend preparation and the kagent adapter:

- Resolve the complete same-namespace rooted tree.
- Reject cycles, shared DAG nodes, different Harnesses, and consecutive Shared depth beyond one per runtime boundary.
- Compile Shared children into native kagent ADK subagents in the parent Actor.
- Preserve each parent-specific binding name, description, prompt, model, skills, and exact tool allowlist.
- Do not expose a public AgentInstance, Actor, or A2A Task for Shared children.

### K9 — Dedicated tools and multi-member topology

Once the single-member lifecycle and its core E2E coverage are in place, add Dedicated boundaries:

- Produce a prepared runtime bundle and ActorTemplate per Dedicated boundary.
- Provision every member through K5’s existing state machine.
- Give each Dedicated binding a private A2A endpoint and credentials scoped to
  exactly that binding and child.
- Stream child A2A events through the parent Task, including progress and
  cancellation, while returning terminal child output to the parent model as
  the tool result.
- Let harness adapters expose the binding through their native mechanism. Use
  an MCP-to-A2A adapter only for harnesses that cannot invoke A2A directly.
- Hide Actor identity, credentials, and arbitrary target selection.
- Persist private binding and conversation handles inside snapshot-covered storage.
- Apply lifecycle and deletion atomically to the complete member set.
- Extend checkpoint and fork atomically across the complete member set.
- Keep child interaction tool-shaped; child `INPUT_REQUIRED` remains deferred.

### K10 — Public AgentInstance A2A gateway

Make the controller the authoritative public A2A v1 gRPC server:

- Route by authenticated AgentInstance authority; never accept Actor addresses.
- Persist public Tasks, messages, artifacts, and an ordered append-only event log.
- Commit every update before publishing it.
- When a Task reaches a terminal or interrupting state (`INPUT_REQUIRED` or
  `AUTH_REQUIRED`), persist its history boundary, suspend the root Actor, and
  record the exact returned snapshot identity and UID before publishing that
  quiescent state.
- Keep the AgentInstance logically `READY` after automatic post-turn
  suspension; the next interaction resumes the Actor transparently.
- Enforce one non-terminal Task per AgentInstance transactionally.
- Implement message idempotency, conflicting-ID rejection, cancellation, reconnect, get/list, filtering, and history/artifact shaping.
- Perform Task filtering, stable ordering, total counting, and pagination in PostgreSQL with queries scoped by AgentInstance; Go validates page tokens and shapes history/artifacts but does not load, filter, or sort complete Task sets in memory or inherit session-backed query semantics.
- Generate the Agent Card from the pinned root template and gateway capabilities.
- Proxy to the root runtime’s private A2A endpoint without leaking private IDs.
- Never automatically replay an input after an ambiguous runtime disconnect.
- Apply creator/operator/share authorization independently for lifecycle, interaction, history, and cancellation.

The old session-backed A2A handler remains only until UI cutover.

K10 progress:

- Completed: authenticated routing and runtime proxying; durable Task and event persistence; database-backed get/list/filter/count/pagination and history/artifact shaping; the one-active-Task constraint; and message idempotency with conflicting-ID rejection.
- Remaining parallel slices: cancellation and reconnect/subscription;
  automatic post-turn suspension; generated Agent Card; creator/operator/share
  authorization coverage; consolidate each Task/event/snapshot persistence
  boundary into one PostgreSQL statement (2→1 queries for regular events and
  3→1 for quiescent snapshot events); and Kind end-to-end coverage.

### K11 — Agent-to-Agent delegation and approval profile

Add the remaining interaction semantics:

- Target-ready and busy checks.
- Short-lived target-scoped delegated credentials.
- Trusted parent/root Task lineage, depth limits, deadline propagation, and cycle detection.
- Optional MCP convenience invocation routed through the same gateway.
- Versioned A2A `DataPart` profile for approvals and input-required continuation.
- Reject untrusted lineage or authorization metadata supplied by runtimes.

Each accepted delegated invocation creates a normal public Task on the target AgentInstance.

### K12 — UI and browser BFF cutover

Replace session-centric UI behavior:

- List AgentTemplates and AgentInstances separately.
- Create an AgentInstance before opening chat.
- Use AgentInstance ID as the conversation and routing identity.
- Replace session sidebars, rename, deletion, lifecycle status, and actor controls with AgentInstance operations.
- Use a thin Next.js BFF to bridge authenticated browser HTTPS/SSE to canonical A2A gRPC.
- Keep no Task state machine in the BFF.
- Move share-link UI to AgentInstance share RPCs.
- Render complete history using A2A `ListTasks`.
- Support suspended, resuming, failed, busy, reconnecting, and input-required states.
- Remove SandboxAgent and AgentHarness forms and ACP-specific chat branches.

UI work can begin against K2-generated mocks and merge after K10.

### K13 — CLI, MCP, examples, and Helm cutover

CLI:

- Apply Harness and AgentTemplate manifests.
- Create/list/get/suspend/resume/delete AgentInstances through gRPC.
- Invoke and follow Tasks through upstream A2A.
- Remove SandboxAgent, AgentHarness, Deployment, BYO, session, and ACP branches.

MCP:

- Discover ready AgentInstances.
- Invoke them only through the public gateway A2A path.
- Expose durable A2A turns through the MCP Tasks extension, including polling,
  cancellation, and input-required continuation.
- Keep synchronous `tools/call` fallback for clients without Tasks support.
- Store no MCP-owned task or session state.
- Never expose Actor or private MCP endpoints.

Content:

- Convert examples to Harness/AgentTemplate/AgentInstance workflows.
- Ship no default Helm agents.
- Document that Substrate is mandatory.
- Update Helm RBAC and values for the new CRDs and gateway.
- Do not promise legacy session or CRD migration.

### K14 — Codex Harness adapter

Implement the second release-blocking adapter:

- Render Shared children into private `CODEX_HOME/agents/*.toml`.
- Render explicit MCP bindings into Codex configuration.
- Materialize selected skills into the pinned runtime layout.
- Drive `codex exec --json` and `codex exec resume`.
- Preserve threads, workspace, MCP handles, and adapter state in DurableDir.
- Map Codex output, tool calls, approvals, cancellation, and failures to the private upstream A2A service.
- Publish only capabilities proven by the conformance suite.

OpenClaw, Hermes, hosted profiles, and shared-host topology are separate future PRs.

### K15 — Claude Harness adapter

Implement the third release-blocking adapter:

- Render Shared children and explicit MCP bindings into Claude's native
  configuration.
- Materialize selected skills into the pinned runtime layout.
- Drive the pinned Claude runtime through its non-interactive streaming interface.
- Preserve conversations, workspace, MCP handles, and adapter state in DurableDir.
- Map Claude output, tool calls, approvals, cancellation, and failures to the private upstream A2A service.
- Publish only capabilities proven by the conformance suite.

### S1 — Upstream Substrate immutable ActorSnapshot API ✅

Released in Substrate v0.0.20:

- Immutable ActorSnapshot identity and Get/List APIs.
- Durable suspend returns the Actor with its exact latest snapshot.
- FULL and DATA scope semantics.
- Immutable snapshot tags provide retention and deletion protection.
- Coverage for supported sandbox/storage implementations.

### S2 — Upstream snapshot-sourced Actor creation ✅

Released in Substrate v0.0.20:

- Allow `CreateActor` from an immutable source snapshot tag.
- Create the target initially suspended with a new Actor identity.
- Validate ActorTemplate and snapshot compatibility.
- Ensure FULL restoration includes process and filesystem state.
- Record the exact resolved snapshot identity and UID on the new Actor.
- Add clone, resume, deletion, and incompatibility conformance tests.

### K16 — Adopt released Substrate snapshot APIs

- Add client wrappers for suspend, snapshot tags, and snapshot-sourced Actor creation.
- Record the root runtime's exact snapshot identity and UID at each quiescent
  turn boundary.
- Verify kagent does not infer snapshot identity from “latest” state.
- Add integration tests for failure and tag/reference cleanup.

### K17 — Checkpoint service

Implement checkpoints as retained turn boundaries:

- Fence the AgentInstance and require a quiescent turn boundary.
- Create an immutable retention tag for that boundary's recorded snapshot,
  verifying its identity and UID.
- Publish a Checkpoint only after its snapshot tag and matching history head
  and sequence are committed.
- Keep the source AgentInstance ID as provenance rather than checkpoint ownership;
  deleting the source must not delete its retained checkpoint or tag.
- Record the immutable snapshot content scope. Future sharing may publish only
  `DATA` snapshots, which contain durable data without process memory or root
  filesystem changes.
- Do not suspend or resume the Actor as part of checkpoint creation.
- Keep partial checkpoints invisible and mark ambiguous failures explicitly.
- Delete only when no fork or retained lineage references its snapshots.
- Make repeated request IDs idempotent.

Checkpoint contents exclude external MCP-owned mutable state.

### K18 — Fork from checkpoint

Implement `ForkAgentInstance`:

- Require same-namespace target ownership.
- Create a new Actor identity from the checkpoint's retained snapshot tag.
- Create a new AgentInstance, A2A authority, creator ownership, and labels.
- Keep source instance, history, and snapshots immutable.
- Represent inherited history through copy-on-write projections: deterministic fork-local Task IDs and the new context ID reference immutable source payloads and lineage without duplicating content.
- New Tasks append only to the fork.
- Return ready only after the cloned Actor resumes and passes health.

In-place restore is not added.

### K19 — Remove legacy APIs and storage

After K12–K18 are merged:

- Delete SandboxAgent and AgentHarness CRDs, controllers, translators, routes, RBAC, UI, CLI, ACP gateway, and generated artifacts.
- Delete `SessionService`, legacy session sharing, `TaskStoreService`, and runtime controller clients.
- Remove session/event/generic-agent tables and session TTL configuration.
- Retain the new AgentInstance, public A2A task/event, checkpoint, operation, and share tables.
- Retain only the browser BFF and canonical gRPC gateway.
- Remove obsolete tests instead of translating Agent-specific fixtures.
- Add repository checks proving no legacy kinds, routes, services, or Deployment-mode selectors remain.

No automatic migration of legacy Sessions or live SandboxAgents is provided. Alpha users must recreate configuration and instances.

### K20 — Release conformance and CI gate

Enable blocking clean-install coverage:

- kagent, Codex, and Claude Harnesses.
- Prompt/model/MCP/skills/plugins.
- Shared tools.
- Create idempotency and controller restart at each provisioning step.
- Public A2A send/stream/get/list/cancel/reconnect and busy rejection.
- Automatic suspend after every quiescent turn, transparent resume on the next
  interaction, and recovery across crashes between runtime completion,
  snapshot creation, and final event publication.
- Read-only/read-write shares.
- Suspend/resume with durable private state.
- Single-member checkpoint consistency and fork independence.
- Snapshot failure, missing Actor, source deletion, and cleanup behavior.
- Browser BFF and UI workflows.
- CRD generation, Helm lint/render, Buf lint/breaking/generation, Go/Python/UI tests.

Substrate Kind E2E may remain disabled during earlier PRs, but it is blocking here. Legacy upgrade tests remain intentionally unsupported; the release gate tests clean installation and new-version persistence only.

## Parallelization

After K0:

- API lane: K1 → K3 → K7/K8. K9 follows the single-member lifecycle and core E2E coverage.
- Control-plane lane: K2, then prepare K5 database/service work.
- Runtime lane: K4 independently.
- External lane: S0 can unlock K5A at any time after K5; S1 → S2 independently.
- UI lane: begin K12 against K2 mocks; integrate after K10.
- Codex and Claude lanes: begin after K3’s resolved-bundle contract; integrate independently after K8.

High-conflict integration files should have one owner at a time:

- Protobuf/Buf configuration: K2, then K10/K17.
- Database migrations/sqlc: K3, then K5/K10/K17.
- Controller application wiring: K5, K10, then K19.
- Generated CRDs/RBAC: K1, then K19.

K7 and K8 should branch from K3 and avoid editing each other’s source-specific compiler packages. K14 and K15 should consume the resolved-bundle interface without modifying the central graph resolver.

## Milestone gates

- Preview 1: K0–K6 — single kagent AgentTemplate can prepare, instantiate, chat, suspend, resume, and delete through final APIs.
- Preview 2: K7–K8 and K10–K15 — full configuration, Shared composition, Codex, Claude, UI, CLI, and MCP behavior.
- Release candidate: S1–S2 and K16–K19 — checkpoint/fork complete and legacy surface deleted.
- API v2 complete: K20 passes with all three release-blocking adapters and Substrate E2E.

## Deliberate exclusions

- No AgentHost, HostedAgent, shared Actors, managed native profiles, or channels.
- No OpenClaw or Hermes release requirement.
- No BYO/fallback runtime.
- No cross-namespace references.
- No multiple conversations or parallel Tasks per AgentInstance.
- No template inheritance, BaseContext, shared-store, or filesystem CRDs.
- No external MCP state checkpointing.
- No legacy Session/SandboxAgent data migration.
- No placeholder APIs for deferred features.
