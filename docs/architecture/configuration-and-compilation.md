# Configuration and Compilation

## Public configuration

`Harness` describes how to run a class of agents. It selects exactly one runtime
variant—kagent, Codex, Claude, or BYO—and contains workload image/command/args,
environment and credential references, WorkerPool configuration, snapshot
location, and an admission selector.

`AgentTemplate` describes what the agent does. It contains model configuration,
description and prompt, MCP tool bindings, skills, plugins, and Shared or
Dedicated agent bindings. Model configuration may be omitted for BYO images;
pair compilation rejects managed harness combinations without one.

Both are `kagent.dev/v1alpha3` Kubernetes resources. Infrastructure-derived
values such as runtime addresses and inferred egress do not belong in the public
API.

## Prepared revision pipeline

The v2 controller collects admitted Harness/AgentTemplate pairs and compiles each
pair through one pipeline:

    H[Harness] --> MATCH{admission selector matches}
    AT[AgentTemplate] --> MATCH
    MATCH --> RESOLVE[resolve template tree and references]
    RESOLVE --> INPUTS[build explicit inputs]
    INPUTS --> REGISTRY{runtime type}
    REGISTRY --> K[kagent compiler]
    REGISTRY --> X[Codex compiler]
    REGISTRY --> C[Claude compiler]
    REGISTRY --> B[BYO compiler]
    K --> REV[immutable revision and digest]
    X --> REV
    C --> REV
    B --> REV
    REV --> ATE[ate-api ActorTemplate]
    ATE --> GOLDEN[golden snapshot]
    GOLDEN -->|ready| LATEST[latest successful revision]
    RESOLVE -->|error| STATUS[pair status]
    ATE -->|error| STATUS
```

1. Resolve the template tree and referenced Kubernetes objects.
2. Build explicit, harness-independent inputs.
3. Select the harness compiler from the runtime-type registration map.
4. Produce an immutable revision containing workload, configuration, Agent Card,
   capacity, snapshot, provenance, and inferred egress inputs.
5. Hash the revision and apply it as an ate-api ActorTemplate.
6. Wait for the golden snapshot to become ready.
7. Persist the revision and advance the pair's latest-successful pointer.

A failed compile or apply leaves the previous successful revision available.
AgentInstances pin a prepared revision, so later template edits do not mutate a
running instance.

Harness compilers only translate inputs. The controller and Substrate adapter own
application and readiness. The central entry points are
[`translator/compiler.go`](../../go/core/internal/translator/compiler.go) and
[`controller/reconciler.go`](../../go/core/internal/controller/reconciler.go).

## Harness-specific output

- **kagent** emits Go ADK configuration, Shared native subagents, and the kagent
  HITL extension.
- **Codex** emits native App Server configuration, OpenAI or Bedrock model setup,
  Streamable HTTP MCP servers, Shared agents, and skills. Approvals are currently
  disabled by policy.
- **Claude** emits Anthropic, Bedrock, or Vertex model setup, HTTP/SSE MCP
  servers, Shared agents, and skills.
- **BYO** runs a digest-pinned user image that implements private A2A gRPC and
  `/readyz`. Optional model, prompt, tool, skill, and plugin configuration is
  supplied in the ADK-shaped format when requested.

Dedicated agent bindings are not compiled yet.
