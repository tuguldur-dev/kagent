# Runtime and Lifecycle

An `AgentInstance` is PostgreSQL-backed control-plane state exposed through gRPC.
It pins one prepared revision and names one Substrate Actor. It is not a
Kubernetes resource.

## Creation and state

Creation selects the latest successful revision for the Harness/AgentTemplate
pair, creates a deterministic Actor initially suspended, and marks the instance
ready after Substrate accepts it. Readiness of the image was already established
while preparing the ate-api ActorTemplate; AgentInstance creation does not resume
an Actor merely to probe `/readyz`.

Lifecycle operations are implemented as retryable workflows:

- database compare-and-set operations claim a transition;
- network work happens without holding a database transaction or lock;
- completion records the resulting state;
- retries observe and continue the durable phase.

Explicit suspend and resume update the logical lifecycle state. Deletion fences
the instance, deletes the Actor, then removes control-plane state. The workflow
entry points are in
[`go/core/internal/service/agentinstance`](../../go/core/internal/service/agentinstance).

## Automatic quiescence

After an A2A task reaches a quiescent boundary—terminal, `input-required`, or
`auth-required`—the gateway asks the lifecycle workflow to quiesce the Actor.
Quiescence suspends compute and returns the exact snapshot identity while leaving
the AgentInstance logically ready. Substrate ingress resumes a suspended Actor
automatically when the next interaction arrives.

Runtime calls and quiescence are serialized by an in-memory coordinator so a
late suspend cannot race a new turn in one process. This intentionally limits the
gateway to one replica until coordination is moved to a shared store.

## Runtime boundaries

- Port `8083` serves native gRPC, gRPC-Web, A2A, authenticated MCP, and health.
- Actor A2A gRPC is private on port `80`.
- Runtime readiness is private HTTP `/readyz` on port `8081`.
- ate-api defaults to `dns:///api.ate-system.svc:443`.

Clients never receive Actor addresses. The gateway derives and dials them through
the private atenetwork router.

Every Actor mounts a Substrate `DurableDir` at `/data`. Harnesses keep private
state there—local framework state, workspaces, and downloaded assets that must
survive Actor replacement. This state is runtime-private; public task history
remains in PostgreSQL.
