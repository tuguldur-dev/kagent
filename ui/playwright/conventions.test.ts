 * The layout rules from `README.md`, checked.
 *
 * Two of the four were already enforced by ESLint — the shared fixture import and
 * antd's class names — and the other two were not enforced by anything, which this
 * branch's own README calls the way a convention regrows as an exception. It was
 * right: `auth/` had drifted and nothing said so.
 *
 * Here rather than in ESLint because these are claims about the *tree*: which folder a
 * file sits in, and how many specs a folder holds. A lint rule sees one file at a time
 * and would need a config block per folder to say it.
 *
 * The parse is deliberately shallow — the naming token of each top-level `test.describe`
 * or `test` at column zero, by regex rather than by AST. A nested describe or an oddly
 * indented test is invisible to it. That is a real limit and an acceptable one: this
 * checks a naming convention, and a title it cannot see is a title nobody greps for
 * either.
