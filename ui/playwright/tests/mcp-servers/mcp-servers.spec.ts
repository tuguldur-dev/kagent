 * `playwright/README.md`.
 *
 * **There is no update half, and that is the product rather than an omission.**
 * `ToolService` serves create, list and delete and no update: a registered server's
 * address is its identity, so changing where it points is deregistering one server
 * and registering another. The journey is create, read, delete.
 *
 * The thing worth pinning on the read is the tool count per server, because it is
 * derived rather than reported: the API returns a server with its discovered tools
 * nested, and the list has to count them. A server that discovered none is the case
 * most likely to be got wrong, so it is asserted explicitly.
