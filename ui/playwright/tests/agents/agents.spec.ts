/**
 * Agents — what can be run, and what each one is.
 *
 * An agent is an `AgentTemplate` paired with a `Harness`. An `AgentInstance` is one
 * *conversation* with an agent, not an agent — the A2A gateway files every task
 * under the instance as the task's `contextId`, so an instance holds a single thread
 * of turns. This page used to list those, under a heading that said "Agents".
 *
 * ## What this covers, and why each thing is here
 *
 * The properties a page cannot show you it got wrong:
 *
 * - **A row is a pair.** One template admitted by two harnesses is two agents, and
 *   the fixtures carry exactly that case. A page keyed on the template would render
 *   one row, look entirely correct, and merge two agents' conversations.
 * - **A template nothing admits is no agent.** It reaches no prepared revision and
 *   every `CreateAgentInstance` naming it is refused, so listing it as a runnable
 *   agent would be listing something that cannot run.
 * - **Selecting no namespace means all of them**, which is one state rather than two
 *   controls that could disagree — the toggle-beside-a-single-select this replaced.
 * - **The revision state is three answers, not two.** "Preparing" is not a failure
 *   and "not reported" is not one either.
 *
 * ## Why the assertions read the state and not the wording
 *
 * The revision tag carries its state in `data-revision-state` beside its label. The
 * wording is a product decision and may change; the state is derived from the
 * controller's status and may not. Asserting the value means a rename is a
 * deliberate edit here rather than a broken suite, while a row showing the wrong
 * state still fails.
