/**
 * An agent's own page — the surface between the agents list and a chat.
 *
 * Named for the page rather than for conversations, because a conversation shows up
 * on three surfaces and only one of them is here: this page's table, the rail on the
 * chat page, and the transcript in the middle of it. The folder is the surface, so
 * "which spec owns this" has an answer — see `README.md`. **This file owns renaming
 * and deleting a conversation**; the rail keeps one test for doing either without
 * leaving the conversation, which is the only thing that table cannot say.
 *
 * Three things about the page are worth pinning, and each is a claim a screenshot
 * cannot check:
 *
 * - **The list is this agent's conversations, narrowed by the server.** Two agents
 *   cut from one template must not show each other's, and `ListAgentInstances` takes
 *   both halves of the pair for exactly that reason. A client-side filter on the
 *   template alone would pass every visual inspection and merge the two.
 * - **A conversation has a name, and an unnamed one is not a bare UUID.** That was
 *   the thing that made the old list unreadable — rows of hex under a heading — so
 *   what it degrades to is asserted rather than assumed.
 * - **Somebody else's conversation is listed and cannot be opened.** `all_creators`
 *   is always asked for now, and `GetAgentInstance` is scoped to its creator, so
 *   such a row is genuinely a dead end. Offering a link into a chat that answers
 *   `NotFound` would be worse than not listing it at all.
