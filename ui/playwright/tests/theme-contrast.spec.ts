 * Text the brand colour is painted with has to be readable on the page it sits on.
 *
 * Three separate places got this wrong the same way: `primary` is a deep purple chosen as
 * a *fill* with light text on it, and used as ink on the dark theme's near-black page it
 * measured 2.2:1 to 2.5:1 where small text needs 4.5. Each was found by measuring rather
 * than looking — which is the point of this spec: a purple-on-near-black link looks
 * deliberate in a screenshot, and a reviewer flicking between themes will not catch it.
 *
 * The ratios are computed the way the eye sees them, compositing every translucent layer
 * down to an opaque colour. Reading the first non-transparent background and treating it
 * as opaque reports a *tinted* panel as a solid brand fill and fails a colour that is
 * fine — which happened while investigating this, and cost a wrong conclusion.
