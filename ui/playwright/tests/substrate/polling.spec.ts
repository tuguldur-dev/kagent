/**
 * Watching the substrate move.
 *
 * "Worker pod" changes on its own — the substrate suspends an actor and restarts it
 * elsewhere — so a page read once shows a placement that has already moved. Polling is
 * offered beside Refresh and is off until asked for: twice a second is a rate to watch
 * something at, not a rate to leave a page at.
 *
 * ## What is counted, and why it is not requests
 *
 * Reads are counted as *operations*, not as HTTP requests, because in mock mode there
 * are none: the API is served by a substituted transport, so `page.on("request")` sees
 * only the navigation and a `window.fetch` wrapper sees nothing whatever. Both
 * instruments answer zero for a page that is polling perfectly. Counting operations is
 * also what this test means — "refreshes the page" is a claim about reads, not about
 * HTTP — and it survives the next change of transport.
 *
 * The instrument itself must not be able to read zero for the wrong reason, in either
 * direction: `operationCallCounts` throws on an RPC the backend does not serve rather
 * than reporting nought calls to it.
 *
 * The count is what makes this a test rather than a screenshot: the failure that matters
 * is a control that reads "enabled" and polls nothing, which is exactly what the first
 * implementation here did — the caching layer deduplicated its revalidations over a window
 * longer than the interval, turning "twice a second" into once every two and a half.
 *
 * ## Why three RPCs are watched and only two are expected to climb
 *
 * The page reads its inventory as three calls — a page of actors, a page of workers,
 * and the summary the tiles are counted from — plus the list of namespaces. Polling
 * deliberately re-reads the inventory and not the namespace list: that one is the
 * page's scope control, not its data, and re-reading it twice a second is a request per
 * tick that can only ever answer the same thing. Watching it alongside is what makes
 * that a tested decision rather than an accident — a timer wired to "refresh
 * everything" would show up here as the namespace count climbing too.
 *
 * The summary is watched beside the actors because the two must move together. It is
 * the expensive read of the three — ate-api reports no totals, so the controller walks
 * every page of it to count — and it would be tempting to leave it out of the tick. A
 * page whose rows moved while its tiles stood still would be reporting two different
 * moments as one.
