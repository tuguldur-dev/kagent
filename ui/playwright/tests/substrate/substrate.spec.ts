/**
 * Substrate — the inventory, its scope, and the three ways the read can answer.
 *
 * The page used to carry a banner reading "worker pool and actor inventory is not
 * available here… comes from a status endpoint this UI's data layer does not expose yet".
 * That was true when it was written and quietly stopped being true: the endpoint, the
 * client method, the hook and the types were all in place, and only the page had not been
 * told.
 *
 * So this covers what it now shows — four sections, all of them the substrate's own — and,
 * more importantly, that the read's three answers stay distinct. `enabled: false` is a
 * deployment without an ate-api endpoint, which is ordinary rather than broken, and is
 * said in the two tables it actually applies to. `ateApiError` means the Kubernetes-derived
 * halves are complete while the runtime ones may be partial, which is a warning *beside*
 * the data rather than an error instead of it. A page that flattened those into one message
 * would tell an operator their substrate was broken when it was merely switched off.
 *
 * The fixture is built for exactly this: `enabled: true` with an `ateApiError` set, two
 * worker pools across two namespaces, two templates — one Ready in `kagent`, one Pending in
 * `platform` — eight actors and two workers, one of the workers holding nothing. The crashed
 * actor sits last in the fixture and first once sorted, which is what makes the ordering
 * testable at all.
