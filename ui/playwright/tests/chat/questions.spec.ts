/**
 * A turn that ends by asking rather than by finishing.
 *
 * This is the reported "the agent worked and then suddenly stopped": the agent called
 * `ask_user`, its turn parked in `input_required`, and because that state is
 * non-terminal it holds the instance's one active-task slot — so the controller
 * refuses every further message with `FailedPrecondition`. Nothing on screen said any
 * of that, because the question renders as ordinary agent prose and the conversation
 * looks finished.
 *
 * One journey rather than three tests, because there is exactly one way in and the
 * ways out are alternatives to each other: a turn parks, and from there it is
 * answered, discarded, or it blocks the conversation. Each step returns the
 * conversation to a state the next can start from, which is what makes them steps.
 *
 * The fixture is the controller's behaviour, copied — the parked turn survives a
 * reload, a send while it stands is refused in the controller's own words, and
 * cancelling its task frees the conversation.
