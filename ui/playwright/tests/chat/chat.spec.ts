/**
 * Chat — the conversation journey.
 *
 * One continuous story, because that is what a conversation is: open an agent that
 * already has history, add a turn to it, watch the turn stream in, add another, and
 * see the whole thing survive a reload. Splitting these would lose the only thing
 * worth checking — that the message you sent is the one that ended up in the
 * transcript you reload.
 *
 * ## The fixture is silent about the reader's message, because the gateway is
 *
 * `MockChatClient` records what the reader sent and never announces it, which is
 * what the A2A gateway does: measured on 2026-08-24, a completed turn emits a
 * `WORKING` frame and a `COMPLETED` frame and no message frame at all, while
 * `ListTasks` afterwards holds the user's message and nothing else. The fixture used
 * to echo it, and that one generosity kept this file green while the reader's own
 * words were invisible on a cluster until they reloaded. Every "the message is on
 * screen" assertion below therefore checks the client put it there.
 *
 * ## There is no session to open first
 *
 * An `AgentInstance` *is* the conversation: the A2A gateway files every task under
 * the instance as its `contextId`, and `ListTasks` for the instance is the
 * transcript. So arriving at an agent is arriving at its conversation, and the rail
 * beside it lists the *other* conversations with the same agent — which are the
 * sibling instances of the same harness and template.
