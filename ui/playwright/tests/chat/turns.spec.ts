/**
 * A turn that does not finish the way it should.
 *
 * Two independent failure modes, kept as two tests rather than merged into one
 * journey: the turn fails mid-flight, and the reader stops one themselves. Unlike a
 * resource lifecycle — where a broken create genuinely does make the rest moot —
 * these do not build on each other, and folding them together would let a broken
 * retry hide whether cancelling works.
 *
 * What they have in common is the property worth pinning: neither may leave the page
 * stuck with no way forward. The composer comes back, and the conversation takes
 * another message afterwards.
 *
 * `?chat=…` drives the turn's outcome; `?mock=…` drives the API. They fail
 * independently, which is why a failed *list* of conversations lives in
 * `agent-rail.spec.ts` beside the rail that shows it, not here.
