/**
 * Editing a prompt library, from the action that used to go nowhere.
 *
 * The list's edit action landed on the read-only detail page: it promised an edit and
 * delivered the same place the library's name already opened, while
 * `UpdatePromptTemplate` — implemented end to end, from the RPC down to the ConfigMap
 * write — was reachable from nowhere in the app. So a library could be created and
 * read and then never changed.
 *
 * Driven as journeys rather than as page tests because the interesting parts are the
 * joins: that both edit actions reach the form, that a save replaces the library
 * rather than merging into it, and that the list behind it is re-read. The order the
 * rows arrive in is asserted too — `data` is a map on the wire, so the order is the
 * app's to impose, and the reading page and the form have to agree on it.
