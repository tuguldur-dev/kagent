 * One test, because a video and a trace are recorded per *test* — see
 * `playwright/README.md`.
 *
 * ## The two things a fragment list has that other resources do not
 *
 * **A save replaces the library.** `UpdatePromptTemplate` assigns the ConfigMap's whole
 * `data` map, so removing a row deletes a fragment and two rows sharing a key silently
 * merge into one. Nothing on screen would tell a reader that, so the form says it and
 * refuses both — asserted in step 8, before the save that would otherwise lose prose
 * somebody wrote.
 *
 * **The reads are scoped per namespace.** `ListPromptTemplates` requires a namespace
 * and offers no wildcard, so `usePrompts` fans out one call per namespace rather than
 * narrowing something already fetched. That makes the filter in step 5 a claim about
 * what was *asked for*, and it is also why the timeouts here are longer than the
 * default: under the slow scenario the page waits on the namespace list and then on one
 * call per namespace.
