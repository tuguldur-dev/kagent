/**
 * Harnesses — the whole life of one, in a single journey.
 *
 * One test, because a video and a trace are recorded per *test* — see
 * `playwright/README.md`.
 *
 * **There is no update half.** The tab offers create and delete and no edit, so the
 * journey is create, read back, remove. That is narrower than `HarnessService`, which
 * implements update too — this application has never called it.
 *
 * ## What the tab exists to say
 *
 * **A harness must not be called broken.** `ready: false` also covers one the controller
 * has not observed yet, which is a different thing from one that failed — and the
 * `kagent` harness on the development cluster is exactly that: it runs agents and carries
 * `status: null`. Calling that "broken" sends somebody debugging a harness that works.
 *
 * ## Why the form is short
 *
 * The CRD is strict, and the constraints the form enforces are the cluster's rather than
 * this page's: exactly one runtime adapter, an image pinned by digest, and a worker pool
 * for the Substrate Actors to be scheduled onto. A form that accepted a tag would build a
 * resource the cluster rejects — the failure that is invisible until somebody tries it
 * for real, which is why the fixture refuses it too.
