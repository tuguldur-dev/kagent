/**
 * Agent templates — what an agent does, authored and read on its own pages.
 *
 * ## The property this suite exists for
 *
 * **A template no harness admits cannot be used, and nothing about it looks
 * wrong.** A `Harness` admits templates through a label selector, and the CRD is
 * explicit that a harness with no selector admits none — so a template whose labels
 * match nothing reaches no prepared revision and every `CreateAgentInstance` naming
 * it is refused. It still has a model, a prompt, a row in this list.
 *
 * That was confirmed against a cluster before any of this was built: an unlabelled
 * template sat at `status: {observedGeneration: 1}` with no harnesses at all, and
 * adding the one label its harness selects on took it to *"ActorTemplate golden
 * snapshot is ready"* in about ten seconds.
 *
 * So the "Runs on" column, the warning in the form and the button that applies a
 * harness's labels are the feature, not decoration — and they are what this covers.
 *
 * ## The second property, newer
 *
 * **Reading a template is not the same act as changing one.** A row used to open the
 * edit form, so looking at a template put the reader in a page of inputs with Save
 * waiting. It now opens a details page with editing as a mode, so the specs below
 * assert on the *reading* state as well as the writing one — and on the fact that
 * both are the same component, since a separate read-only view is what would drift.
