/**
 * Agent templates — the whole life of one, in a single journey.
 *
 * One test, because a video and a trace are recorded per *test* — see
 * `playwright/README.md`.
 *
 * ## The property this spec exists for
 *
 * **A template no harness admits cannot be used, and nothing about it looks wrong.** A
 * `Harness` admits templates through a label selector, and the CRD is explicit that a
 * harness with no selector admits none — so a template whose labels match nothing
 * reaches no prepared revision and every `CreateAgentInstance` naming it is refused. It
 * still has a model, a prompt, a row in this list.
 *
 * That was confirmed against a cluster before any of this was built: an unlabelled
 * template sat at `status: {observedGeneration: 1}` with no harnesses at all, and adding
 * the one label its harness selects on took it to *"ActorTemplate golden snapshot is
 * ready"* in about ten seconds.
 *
 * So the "Runs on" column, the warning in the form and the button that applies a
 * harness's labels are the feature, not decoration — and they are what steps 1, 4 and 5
 * cover.
 *
 * ## The second property
 *
 * **Reading a template is not the same act as changing one.** A row opens a details
 * page with editing as a mode rather than a page of inputs with Save waiting, which is
 * why steps 6 and
 * 7 assert the *reading* state as well as the writing one — and why they assert both are
 * the same component, since a separate read-only view is what would drift.
 *
 * ## One thing the ordering buys, and one it costs
 *
 * The mock backend keeps writes in the page's own memory, so a `page.goto` starts a
 * backend that has never heard of the template just made. Everything from step 5 onwards
 * therefore clicks through rather than navigating, and the created template survives all
 * the way to the delete that removes it. The cost is that a failure stops the steps after
 * it; the recording shows where.
 */
