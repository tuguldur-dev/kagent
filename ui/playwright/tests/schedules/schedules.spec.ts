/**
 * Schedules — the whole life of one, in a single journey.
 *
 * One test, because a video and a trace are recorded per *test* — see
 * `playwright/README.md`.
 *
 * ## What is distinctive about this resource, and therefore what is covered
 *
 * **A schedule is the only resource here that runs.** So the journey covers pausing one,
 * invoking it by hand while paused, and reading the execution it produced — none of which
 * any other resource has, and all of which is the reason a schedule exists.
 *
 * **Its cadence has two representations.** The form offers a repeat picker and an
 * advanced cron expression, and an expression the picker cannot represent has to survive
 * an edit to some other field. That is asserted because it is the one that silently
 * destroys a reader's work.
 *
 * **Its history outlives it.** A deleted schedule still opens by address and says what it
 * is, because the executions are retained — so the address is not a 404 and must not be
 * rendered as a live schedule either.
 *
 * ## What is still read as prose, deliberately
 *
 * Five selectors, and each is the right tool rather than a leftover. Two are fixture
 * *data* in a cell — an execution's failure reason, its task id — which is the thing
 * under test and has no id to give it. One is a form rule's message. The last two are
 * `getByLabel("Monday")` on the weekday checkboxes, which are genuinely labelled
 * controls: a label is what a reader clicks and what a screen reader announces, so
 * reaching for one is not the same as matching copy.
 *
 * ## Why it clicks through rather than navigating
 *
 * The mock backend keeps writes in the page's own memory, so a `page.goto` starts a
 * backend that has never heard of the schedule just made. Everything from step 4 onwards
 * therefore clicks, and the created schedule survives to the delete at the end.
