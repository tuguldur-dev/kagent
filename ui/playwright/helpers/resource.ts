 * merely long. A lifecycle is a dozen steps and four round trips through forms, so
 * the default says nothing about its health there — only about its length.
 *
 * **By shape, not by folder.** Any one test of ten or more steps needs it, wherever it
 * lives — `conventions.test.ts` checks that. Applying it to the resource folders alone
 * left `chat/questions.spec.ts` with twelve steps on the default, which is what timed
 * out in CI at step eight while passing twenty times in isolation.
 *
 * Sixty rather than ninety, and the difference is the point: loose enough for a
 * contended run, tight enough that a journey which doubles in cost is still a
