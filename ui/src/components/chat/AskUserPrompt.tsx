/**
 * The question an agent stopped to ask, as something the reader can answer.
 *
 * The payload is already in the transcript twice — as the `ask_user` tool call and
 * as prose — and both are unusable: one is a JSON blob and the other is a sentence
 * with no way to reply to it. This is the third rendering and the only one that can
 * end the turn.
 *
 * ## What it refuses to do
 *
 * - **It does not offer choices for a request it does not understand.** A
 *   `tool_approval_request`, or a type added after this build, is said plainly and
 *   the only control offered is the one that gives it up. Buttons that post an
 *   answer the runtime will not read are worse than no buttons: the turn resumes,
 *   the agent replies, and nothing reports that the answer went nowhere.
 * - **It does not let the same answer be sent twice.** The runtime refuses the
 *   second, so a control that stayed live would produce a failure the reader caused
 *   by doing the obvious thing.
 * - **It does not send a partial answer.** Every question is answered or none is:
 *   the runtime pairs answers to questions positionally, so a gap silently answers
 *   the wrong question.
