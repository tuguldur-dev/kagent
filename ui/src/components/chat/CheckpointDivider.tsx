 * The line a fork would cut along.
 *
 * Drawn under the last message of a checkpointed turn, because that is what the
 * boundary means: everything above it travels into a fork and nothing below it does.
 * A rule rather than a panel around the turn — a conversation can hold several of
 * these, and stacked boxes read as unrelated cards rather than as one thread with
 * marks in it.
 *
 * The transcript adds the room around this; see `CHECKPOINT_GAP` there.
