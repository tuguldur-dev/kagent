/**
 * Says a delete was refused, three ways, because each reaches a different person.
 *
 * The alert stays on screen beside the rows that did not go, which is where the reader
 * looks when they notice something is still there. The toast catches the reader who has
 * already looked away — a bulk delete is the kind of thing you start and stop watching.
 * And the console carries the whole error for whoever is debugging it later, which
 * neither of the other two can without becoming unreadable.
 *
 * It was none of these: the delete paths had `try`/`finally` and no `catch`, so a
 * refusal closed the dialog, cleared the spinner and reported nothing at all. An
 * instance is scoped to its creator on write, so being refused is an ordinary outcome
 * here rather than an exceptional one — which is exactly why it must be said.
