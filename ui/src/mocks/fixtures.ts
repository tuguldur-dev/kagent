 * - one `failed` carrying a `Failure`, which is the only row that has one;
 * - one whose state the controller never reported, with no harness, no template
 *   and no timestamps — the row that catches a page rendering absent values as
 *   blank cells rather than saying so;
 * - three the caller did not create — two of somebody else's and the barely-written
 *   one, whose creator is nobody at all — so `all_creators` changes the answer from
 *   four rows in `kagent` to seven;
 * - one outside `kagent`, so a page that ignored the namespace it was asked for
 *   would show it in the wrong list.
 *
 * The ids are UUIDs because the controller insists: `validateIdentity` parses one
 * and rejects anything else with `InvalidArgument`, so a friendlier fixture id like
 * "instance-1" would work here and fail against a cluster.
