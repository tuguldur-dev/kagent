/**
 * The harnesses an agent can be built on.
 *
 * A `Harness` is reusable execution configuration: which adapter, which worker pool,
 * which digest-pinned image. `k8s-agent` and `support-triage` are the two the
 * instances above are cut from, so the create form and the instance list agree with
 * each other.
 *
 * The image is digest-pinned because the CRD's CEL rejects a tag, and a fixture
 * carrying a tag would pass every mock test and fail against a cluster — which is
 * exactly the class of failure this file's fixtures have caused before.
