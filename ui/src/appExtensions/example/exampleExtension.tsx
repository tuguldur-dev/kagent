/**
 * A worked example of the extension contract, exercising every capability the

 * application, and is not installed by default.
 *
 * Nothing here is special-cased by the framework: a real extension is a config
 * object of exactly this shape, and installing it is two lines in
 * `src/appExtensions/activeExtensions.ts` — an import, and an entry in the array.
 * Installing a second one alongside it is one more entry.
