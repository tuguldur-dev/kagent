 * The API-layer extension contract.
 *
 * A vendor's control plane rarely lives at the same URLs as the reference one,
 * and rarely speaks the same payload shapes, so an extension needs to say where
 * a call goes and how to reshape it in both directions.
 *
 * The data layer already owns the runtime seam — registries of operation
 * overrides, endpoint overrides and transforms, plus the resolution logic that
 * reads them. This module deliberately does not restate any of that. What it adds
 * is the declarative half: the shape those changes take inside the one global
 * config object, keyed per call, so a vendor declares its API differences
 * alongside its nav items and slots rather than in an imperative bundle entry
 * point. `installVendorApiExtension` folds this shape into the registries.
 *
 * The transform hooks are typed against the data layer's own request and
 * response contexts, so there is exactly one description of a request in the
 * codebase.

 * dispatches on the call's id, so config authors never write that filter.
