/**
 * A running agent, as the v1alpha3 runtime reports it.
 *
 * An `AgentInstance` is not a custom resource — it is a row in the controller's
 * own database, served by `AgentInstanceService` in
 * `proto/kagent/api/v1alpha1/agent_instances.proto` and implemented in
 * `go/core/v2/agentinstance`. So unlike agents, models and prompt libraries,
 * nothing here arrives inside a `StructuredObject`: the proto message *is* the
 * record, and these types mirror it field for field.
 *
 * ## Two enums, spelled as words
 *
 * `state` and `operation` are proto enums, which the generated code represents as
 * numbers. Numbers are the wrong thing to carry into a page: they sort and compare
 * as integers, they mean nothing in a test failure, and a `Record<number, ...>`
 * lookup on a value this build has never heard of yields `undefined` silently.
 * They are converted once, at the client boundary, into the string unions below —
 * and a value outside them becomes `"unknown"` rather than vanishing, so a UI
 * built against an older proto than the cluster says so instead of rendering a
 * blank cell.
 *
 * ## What "unspecified" means, and what it does not
 *
 * Proto3 gives every enum a zero value, and both of these use it. The controller
 * leaves `operation` at zero when no lifecycle operation is in flight, so
 * `"unspecified"` there reads as "nothing happening" — but that is the *controller's*
 * convention rather than something the wire distinguishes, and a record that was
 * never written would look identical. `state` at zero has no such convention: it
 * means the controller did not say. Both are rendered as their own thing on screen
 * rather than being folded into a plausible-looking default.
