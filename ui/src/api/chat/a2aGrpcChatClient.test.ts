 * The behaviours the chat client must keep, now that it reads proto rather than JSON.

 * Its predecessor carried a large suite, most of which was about *decoding*: a keyed
 * union with no discriminator, enums spelled as `TASK_STATE_*`, parts with no `kind`,
 * two spellings of `role` in one stream, and frames split across chunk boundaries.
 * None of that exists over gRPC-Web — protobuf-es decodes the wire — so those tests
 * went with the code they guarded.
 *
 * What is tested here is the half that was never about the wire: turning a stream of
