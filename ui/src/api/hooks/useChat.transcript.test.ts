/**
 * The reader's own message, and what happens to it afterwards.
 *
 * The defect these cover was reported from a cluster and invisible in fixtures:
 * the transcript showed only the agent's replies, and the reader's questions
 * appeared only after a reload. The cause was that this hook waited to be told its
 * own message existed, and the A2A gateway never tells it — measured on
 * 2026-08-24, a completed turn emits a `WORKING` frame and a `COMPLETED` frame and
 * no message frame at all, while `ListTasks` afterwards holds the user's message
 * and nothing else.
 *
 * So every client below is **silent about the user's message**, the way the
 * gateway is. A client that echoed it would pass these tests without the hook
 * doing anything, which is exactly how the browser suite came to be green over
 * this.
