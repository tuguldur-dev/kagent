/**
 * The agents in the cluster: one row per `(AgentTemplate, Harness)` pair.
 *
 * ## Why this page lists pairs and not `AgentInstance`s
 *
 * Because an instance is a *conversation*, not an agent. The A2A gateway files every
 * task under its instance as the task's `contextId`, so an instance is one thread of
 * turns — and this page, listing them under a heading of "Agents", was listing
 * conversations. Every symptom followed from that: nothing to search on, two rows
 * from one template that could not be told apart, and a "create agent" form that was
 * two dropdowns because it was not creating an agent.
 *
 * The durable, runnable thing is the pair. `agent_template_harness_pair` is a real
 * table with a revision lifecycle of its own, and it is already on the wire as
 * `AgentTemplate.status.harnesses[]` — one entry per pair — which is what the
 * templates page's "Runs on" column reads. So listing agents costs no new RPC and no
 * new service: it is the template read, regrouped. See `api/domain/agentPairs`.
 *
 * ## Why one template can be two rows
 *
 * A harness admits templates by label selector, and two harnesses can select the
 * same one. That is genuinely two agents — the same behaviour on two runtimes, each
 * with its own prepared revision and its own conversations — so it is two rows,
 * distinguished by the harness column. Collapsing them would hide the one thing that
 * differs.
 *
 * ## Why the search and sort are in the browser, and why that is honest here
 *
 * `ListAgentTemplates` takes exactly one field: a namespace. No page, no filter, no
 * sort. So the whole list arrives in one read and narrowing it in the browser covers
 * every row there is — which the note under the table says, naming the RPC, because
 * a search box that only searched the page in front of you looks identical to one
 * that searched everything.
 *
 * ## Why the conversation counts can be partial, and say so
 *
 * They come from `ListAgentInstances`, which has no cross-namespace read — so a wide
 * count is a request per namespace, and each namespace is authorised on its own. A
 * refused one is named rather than quietly making a column read lower than the truth.
