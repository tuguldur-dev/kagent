/**
 * One agent, and the conversations people have had with it.
 *
 * An agent is a `(AgentTemplate, Harness)` pair and an `AgentInstance` is one
 * conversation with it — so this is the page between the two: the agents list leads
 * here, and each row here leads to a chat. See `api/domain/agentPairs`.
 *
 * ## The narrowing here really is server-side
 *
 * `ListAgentInstances` gained `agent_template` and `harness`, which the controller
 * resolves through the instance's `prepared_revision` to the pair it was built from.
 * That matters twice over: the list is paged, so filtering it in the browser would
 * search one page and report "no conversations" about a row further down; and
 * resolving through the revision rather than through labels selects conversations
 * stored before the fields existed, with no migration and no backfill.
 *
 * Search and sort are still the browser's, over whatever pages have been read, and
 * the note under the table says so rather than implying otherwise.
 *
 * ## Somebody else's conversation is listed and cannot be opened
 *
 * This is the part worth reading before changing anything here. The list is asked
 * for with `all_creators` always — the old "include agents created by others" switch
 * is gone, because a list that hides most of a shared cluster by default is a list
 * that misleads. But an instance is scoped to its creator on *read*:
 * `GetAgentInstance` resolves through `WHERE namespace = $1 AND id = $2 AND user_id
 * = $3`, and the A2A gateway reads the instance through that same call. So a
 * conversation somebody else started is listable and genuinely not openable — its
 * record page and its chat both answer `NotFound`, and a share link is the only way
 * in.
 *
 * Listing such a row with a link into a chat that will fail would be worse than not
 * listing it at all, so those rows carry no link and say whose they are. The page
 * says it once, above the table, so the absence of a link reads as a rule rather
 * than as a bug.
