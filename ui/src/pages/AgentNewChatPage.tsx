/**
 * A conversation with an agent that has not been created yet.
 *
 * ## Why this page exists at all
 *
 * "New chat" used to call `CreateAgentInstance` and navigate to the result, so the
 * instance existed the moment somebody clicked — and every visit that changed its mind
 * left an empty conversation behind for good. That is not hypothetical: the live
 * cluster carries nine of them, all unnamed, none with a single message, and the pool
 * ran out of workers twice during one afternoon's recording because of it. An instance
 * is not free — it holds a prepared revision, and deleting the last instance that
 * references a revision does not collect it.
 *
 * So the instance is created by the **first message**. Until then this is a page with a
 * composer and nothing behind it, which is exactly what the reader has.
 *
 * ## The two things this has to get right
 *
 * **The request id is minted once per draft, not once per send.** `CreateAgentInstance`
 * takes one for idempotency; minting a fresh one on a retry would turn a failed send
 * that actually succeeded into two conversations. It is reset only after a create
 * lands, when the next message belongs to a conversation that exists.
 *
 * **The message is handed to the chat page rather than sent here.** Sending would mean
 * a second copy of the turn machinery living on a page that has no transcript to put
 * the result in. The text travels in router state and `AgentChatPage` sends it once on
 * arrival — which also means the reader sees their own words in the transcript they
 * will keep reading, rather than watching them disappear from one page and reappear on
 * another.
