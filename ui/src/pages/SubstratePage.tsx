 *
 * ## Three reads, not one
 *
 * This page used to make a single call for the whole inventory, and it stopped
 * working: `GetSubstrateStatus` answers with every actor and every worker in one
 * message, and on a cluster reporting 410,110 actors that is a message gRPC refuses
 * to send — *"trying to send message larger than max"*. The page reported it honestly
 * as a failed read, which was right, and the read could not succeed.
 *
 * So it now reads three things:
 *
 * - **the summary**, for the tiles and for the two lists that are inherently small
 *   (worker pools and actor templates ride inline);
 * - **a page of actors** and **a page of workers**, each `PageRequest`/`PageResponse`
 *   as `ListAgentInstances` does it.
 *
 * ## Where the counts come from, and why it matters
 *
 * Every total on this page is the summary's, computed server-side. None of them is
 * `rows.length`. With the lists paged, counting what arrived and calling it a total
 * would report twenty actors for a cluster running four hundred thousand — the exact
 * failure the "3 of 4" rendering already existed to prevent, made far more likely by
 * paging.
 *
 * ## Why the searches are server-side
 *
 * Because a filter applied to a page searches only that page. A reader searching for
 * an actor on page nine would be told there are no matches, which is worse than no
 * search at all. The term is sent and the server narrows the whole set — the counts
 * beside each heading are then the filtered totals, which is what makes "3 of 4,312"
 * true.
