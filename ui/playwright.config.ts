 * Playwright E2E config for the kagent UI.
 *
 * Data is fetched server-side (Next.js server actions), so browser-level
 * `page.route` cannot intercept `/api/**`. Instead we boot a standalone stub
 * backend (playwright/mocks/server.mjs) and point Next at it via
 * BACKEND_INTERNAL_URL — `getBackendUrl()` (src/lib/utils.ts) checks that env
 * var first. Both servers are started by the `webServer` block below.
 *
 * See playwright/README.md for the full test strategy.
