 * What an extension's settings are named, rather than what they are.

 * An installed extension reads settings this application knows nothing about, and a
 * developer still has to be able to set them in `.env`. This used to be a list of the
 * three the extension happened to want, which meant a public repository enumerating
 * another product's configuration and a change here every time that product grew a
 * setting — for keys nothing in this repository reads.
 *
 * A prefix instead. `readEnv` already takes any key and `window.environmentVariables`
 * is already an open record, so nothing in the application changes when an extension
 * adds a setting: it names it `EXTENSION_SOMETHING` and it arrives.
 *
 * Still bounded, which is the point of `CORE_ENV_KEYS` being a list at all: the dev
 * server inlines these into the document, so a wholesale copy of the environment would
 * publish every credential on the machine into the HTML. A variable has to be
 * deliberately named for an extension to be copied — but only that deliberately, so a
 * stray `EXTENSION_` variable in a shell will be inlined. It is a development server
 * rendering a page for the developer who started it; the container path below is the
 * one that faces a cluster, and there the environment is the chart's own.

 * shell. Inline rather than a served file so it cannot be cached, and so the
 * values are unmistakably present in the document when debugging.
